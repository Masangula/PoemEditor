Hey

I hate saying this but it's the truth that 
I need you the most as my crying shoulder or therapist
You can call it whatever
More than I need you as a BOYFRIEND okay!..

I TRUST you more than I trust Myself
I know you won't belive this
But I know what am saying.

So I need you to  be there for me to listen to me and advise me
Because it always works before I make rough decision
If I talk to you that GOOD part of me beats the EVIL part of me
And I end up being a GOOD GIRL.

But when I try to a HERO and you try to save your PRIDE
Or you can call it whatever BIPOLAR thing, bad things happens to both ends.

I wish you start being that person of more INTELLIGENCE than EMOTIONS like you used to 
Because honestly speaking I miss that Person and I need that person back.
