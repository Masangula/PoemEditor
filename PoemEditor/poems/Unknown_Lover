He is always there
Before I ask
He would provide
My problems
His solution
I am sorry it's not me

Even when he doesn't speak
To his eyes I will see
How much I mean
And how worth I am
The world to him
I am sorry it's not me

He deserve the best
And I am the worst
Tired he don't get
Tolerating my fails
Even if I hurt him
I am sorry it's not me

Away he won't go
Aside he stays
Loyal he is
Even if I lie
Truly he will stay
I am sorry it's not me

The way you feel me
To my heart us nothing
I tried to fake
But it doesn't work
I am sorry it's not me

I am trying to understand
Why can't I give it to you
My heart is away
To someone else
It is owned
I am sorry it's not me

Your treatment are  the best
But I don't deserve
Because inside it's empty
So I can't give you
What i don't have
I am sorry it's not me
